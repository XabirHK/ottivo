## Assumptions

- Contracts starting in the course of the year get 1/12 of the yearly vacation days for each full  month
  
    After calculation output the floor value not the ceiling.
  

- Contracts can start on the 1st or the 15th of a month
  
  The contact which start from the 15th calculating vacation from the next month, assuming the employee doesn't get extra vacation for that 15 days.


- Employees >= 30 years get one additional vacation day every 5 years

  Calculating the 5-year period from the contract start date not the birthdate till the end of the interested yeas not the beginning of the interested year.

  Age is calculated till the end of the interested year.
